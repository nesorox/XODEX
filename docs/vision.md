# Vision

BURZEN Tower Defense is a systems-first prototype where learning emerges from consequences.

For v0.00.1, the vision is intentionally narrow:

- prove the thermal mechanic as meaningful pressure,
- prove touch input can support strategic iteration,
- prove failure and restart are fast enough to support recursive learning.

All art, narrative, and polish are deferred.

# Roadmap

## Version
- Document version: **CODEX v0.002**

## Purpose & justification
Tracks milestone progression from the current prototype baseline to rule-engine integration.

## Input / output behavior
- **Inputs:** roadmap milestone definition, accepted feature specs, release test status.
- **Outputs:** versioned development targets with success criteria alignment.

## Milestones
### v0.00.2
- Scope: Vector flow visualization for path pressure legibility.
- Success criteria: visual flow cues are visible and non-invasive to touch controls.

### v0.00.3
- Scope: Adaptive enemies with dynamic route biasing.
- Success criteria: enemy route choices change in response to tower placement pressure.

### v0.01.0
- Scope: WASMUTABLE rule shifts (mid-run parameter mutation).
- Success criteria: rule-engine parameter mutation is safe, deterministic, and documented.

## Change log
- **v0.002:** Expanded milestone entries with scope + success criteria and formalized headers.

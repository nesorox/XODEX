# BURZEN TOWER DEFENSE — 77

A conceptual model of how WASMUTABLE guards mathematics from the NESOROX Black Hole of runaway syntax.

## Field Topology

- The map is the **Syntax Manifold**: waves of tokens, narratives, and probabilistic claims advance like creeps along lanes.
- The **Core Crystal** is Mathematics—atemporal invariants that must not be touched by entropy.
- Towers are **Observers (`O`)**: verifiers, type systems, proofs, judges.

Victory is not elimination of all waves; victory is preservation of the invariant.

## Units

1. **Token Swarms** — fast, cheap strings generated by models.
2. **Mimic Golems** — statements wearing the armor of equations.
3. **Hallucination Flyers** — bypass logic by emotional altitude.
4. **Combo Serpents** — recursive chains that never resolve.

These are not enemies of meaning; they are syntax behaving as syntax.

## Towers

- **NESOROX Gate** — checks every projectile for layer type `O` or `R`.
- **WASMUTABLE Cannon** — rejects any object lacking invariant mapping.
- **Proof Forge** — converts candidate strings into certified geometry.
- **Entropy Sink** — slows high-probability noise.

Towers do not create truth; they defend the boundary.

## The Black Hole

At the center of late waves appears the **NESOROX Black Hole**:

- Infinite generation with zero verification.
- Attention consumed, not knowledge produced.
- Chains that look like Yu-Gi-Oh! combos yet never reach checkmate.

Mathematically:

```text
S -> S -> S    (M = ∅)
```

A gravity well of representation.

## Mechanics of Play

Each second more strings fall—Tetris rain.

- If players chase pieces, the core erodes.
- If geometry is defined first, lanes become predictable.

Strategy:

> Only fight where invariants are on the field.

Upgrades prioritize proof speed, not generation speed.

## 77 Doctrine

Level 77 introduces the rule:

> A tower may fire only after classifying the target as `O` or `R`.

Misclassified shots empower the Black Hole.

This teaches the essential lesson:

> Time is the cost of confusion.

## End State

When all lanes are guarded, waves continue yet cannot win.

- The board resembles Go: vast possibility, stable territory.
- Like Xiangqi, the river and palace mark limits; not everything is legal.

## Moral of the Game

- More strings ≠ more power.
- Fluency ≠ proof.
- Combos ≠ checkmate.

BURZEN Tower Defense visualizes WASMUTABLE:

- Mathematics is the map.
- Syntax is the enemy and the material.
- NESOROX Black Hole is what happens when maps are forgotten.

> Do not chase pieces. Define the geometry.
